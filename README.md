# Machine-Learning-Engineering-NanoDegree-Final-Project
Final Project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree
  --------------------
  Project Description
  --------------------
    The point of the project is to see if it is possible to time market (S&P 500). A lot of famous investors advise to hold     
    money in S&P over time to accumalte wealth. I wanted to see if Reinforcement Learning could be used to time the market and          
    beat the S&P 500 index. Specifically I used the Q-learning Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
