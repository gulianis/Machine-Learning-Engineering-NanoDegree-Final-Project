    "Many investors such as Warren Buffett say that the best way to accumulate weath is to keep your money in the S&P 500 Index Fund. The S&P 500 is a weighted average of all the stocks of the top 500 companies weighted by the value of the company. Historically S&P 500 has gone 7% above inflation which beats many other funds and performs way better than keeping your money in the bank. My question is whether we can make more than 7% over inflation by timing the market. I want to see if reinforcement learning can be used to predict when the stocks will go up or down and use that information to take money out or put money back in the market."
